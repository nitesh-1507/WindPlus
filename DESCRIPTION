Description: The idea is to take data set from different sources, and
    and filter out observations from each which exhibit similar charactersitics.
    The process of doing so is said to be covariates matching, where two different
    data set are matched using certain nummber of covariates, against a specified
    theshold. Further, the generated matched data set could be used to quantify the
    performance (example : different turbines performance comaprison in wind energy 
    industry and so on) using hypothesis testing and many other approaches.
